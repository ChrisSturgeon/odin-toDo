## Overview

The todo list project from the _Organizing your JavaScript Code_ module of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The aim was to make a todo list app in which users can create todo lists & tasks and categorise them within custom projects. The data is held in local storage to allow the user to return at a later date and update their projects and lists.

### Built With

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- HTML
- CSS

## Features

- Create lists of _todo_ tasks and categorise them within custom projects.
- Designate tasks as high, low and medium priority.
- Assign due dates to individual tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete, or edit the details after creation.

### Concepts and Ideas Learnt

- How to seperate code across mulitple JS files to better organise the code structure, and use **Webpack** bundler along with of ES6 imports/exports to re-assemble the project for deployment.
- Accessing, writing, deleting and editing data held in **local storage**.
- The importance of avoiding **tightly coupled code**. For example, the seperation of app logic and DOM event functions.

### Areas to Improve

If I was to remake or improve this project I would:

- Create a backend for storage of data, so users can access their projects and tasks across different devices.
- Allow users to filter and sort tasks by due date and/or priority.
- Since learning more about accessibility in design, I would choose a different colour scheme as currently there are some accessibility issues.
